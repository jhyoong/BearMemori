# Bug list

## Critical
1. assistant chatbot - unable to actually make tasks or reminders. Telegram interface in this assistance will need a yes / no option for allowing creation of tasks/reminders/memories.

2. When interacting with searched memory (image with no description), the telegram buttons all don't respond except for delete.

## Minor

# Feature updates
## Important
1. Need better visualisation of current queue. Since this system relies on local models which are not stable, there needs to be a more robust handling mechanism in the system to deal with periods of unavailability or failures. 

2. Timezone setting

## Minor
1. Better visualisation of assistant worldview of user.
