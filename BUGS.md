# Bug list

## Critical
1. When searching memories, the returned memory in telegram still comes with 'Confirm Tags', 'Tags' which doesn't make sense for the use case. The only buttons that should come with returned results should be `Edit Tags`, `Create Task`, `Set Reminder`, `Pin`, `Delete`. Also, the `Delete` functions MUST have a confirmation prompt before it can be triggered.
